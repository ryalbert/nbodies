N body solver in Python, as basic as can be. The default execution computes the "A remarkable periodic solution of the three-body problem in the case of equal masses" by Alain Chenciner and Richard Montgomery

Could do : 
- Show computed animation in real time via gumpy
- Improve initial conditions (define other testcases to have better looking systems)
- Implement some algorithm to decrease computation complexity for large numbers ( tree methods, such as a Barnesâ€“Hut simulation )
- Decrease computation complexity by factor 2 by computing forces only once
